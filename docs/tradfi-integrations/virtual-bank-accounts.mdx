# Virtual Bank Accounts

Virtual bank accounts (VBAs) let you give customers unique bank account identifiers that can automatically transfer funds into their Stellar wallets.

### What Are Virtual Bank Accounts?

A virtual bank account provided by third parties is not a real on-chain account. Instead, itâ€™s a reference or identifier tied to your customer's Stellar account in the third party's system. All transactions flow through one **treasury account** and assets are sent to the customer's Stellar account.

### Why Use Virtual Bank Accounts?

Virtual bank accounts are a great way to give your customers a seamless experience when receiving traditional payments. They can provide traditional bank account numbers, and the funds will be automatically transferred to their Stellar wallet as an asset.
