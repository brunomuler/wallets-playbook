# Disbursements Overview

The [Stellar Disbursement Platform](https://stellar.org/products-and-tools/disbursement-platform) (**SDP**) is an open-source solution that makes it easier, faster, and cheaper for organizations to send cross-border payments at scale. Recipients receive payouts directly to a Stellar wallet, where they can hold, send, spend, or convert them into local currency via Stellarâ€™s on- and off-ramp network. 

Today, SDP is used by organizations like the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees](https://www.unhcr.org/) (**UNCHR**) and [Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit](https://www.giz.de/) (**GIZ**) to support real-world use cases like humanitarian aid and payroll. 

**As a wallet provider, there are two primary ways to can engage with the SDP:**

### 1. Make your wallet SDP-compatible
 Each SDP instance must establish a relationship with at least one wallet provider before sending disbursements. By meeting the SDPâ€™s technical and operational requirements, your wallet can become eligible to receive disbursements from any organization using the platform in the regions you support.

### 2. Become an SDP host
 Wallet teams or ecosystem partners can also deploy their own version of the SDP to distribute payments on behalf of organizations directly â€“ to contractors, users, or employees. This can unlock new business models and use cases, especially in regions with fragmented financial infrastructure.
