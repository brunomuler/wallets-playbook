# Disbursements Overview

The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) is an open-source solution that makes it easier, faster, and cheaper for organizations to send cross-border payments at scale. Recipients receive payouts directly to a Stellar wallet, where they can hold, send, spend, or convert them into local currency via Stellar’s on- and off-ramp network. 

Today, SDP is used by organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to support real-world use cases like humanitarian aid and payroll. 

**As a wallet provider, there are two primary ways to can engage with the SDP:**

### 1. Make your wallet SDP-compatible
 Each SDP instance must establish a relationship with at least one wallet provider before sending disbursements. By meeting the SDP’s technical and operational requirements, your wallet can become eligible to receive disbursements from any organization using the platform in the regions you support. 


### 2. Become an SDP host
 Wallet teams or ecosystem partners can also deploy their own version of the SDP to distribute payments on behalf of organizations directly – to contractors, users, or employees. This can unlock new business models and use cases, especially in regions with fragmented financial infrastructure.  

This next section will walk through the technical and operational steps required to make your wallet compatible with the SDP.
