# Introduction

The global wallet market was valued at $3.2B in 2024 and is projected to surpass $33B by 2033. This playbook explores how wallets and applications built on Stellar can capitalize on this growth, from expanding into new markets to offering new, innovative financial services that solve real-world problems.

## Expand Into New Markets

### 1. Strategic Benefits 

As digital assets continue to shape the global financial landscape, entering new markets presents a unique opportunity for growth. Here are a few reasons why entering new markets can be beneficial: 

- **Expand Your Reach**: Entering new markets can help your wallet or application tap into previously underserved or emerging markets, increasing your potential userbase and extending your market presence.

- **Capture the First-Mover Advantage**: By addressing the needs of a new market early, you can establish a strong brand presence and build loyalty before a market becomes crowded.


### 2. Options on Stellar

Stellar provides a suite of tools and integrations designed to simplify market expansion, including:

- **MoneyGram Ramps**: By integrating with MoneyGram's global retail network, your wallet or application can connect to over 180 countries. This single integration allows your users to deposit or withdraw cash via Stellar USDC, without a bank account. It's a powerful way to reach a global audience and lower barriers to entry.

- **The Stellar Anchor Network**: Integrating with anchors – banks, exchanges, and money transfer operators – allows your users to easily convert digital assets to fiat. This provides a trusted, localized way for users to engage with digital assets, simplifying entry into new markets.


### 3. Key Considerations

When evaluating new markets, consider factors like:

- **Product-Market Fit**: Are there unmet needs or pain points in a market that your application or wallet can effectively address?

- **Market Size and Maturity**: What's the size of the market and growth potential? How competitive is the landscape? What's the state of the financial infrastructure?

- **Localization**: Have you considered language, currency, or cultural preferences to ensure your product is accessible and appealing to the market?

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Are there local regulations you need to consider to ensure your product is compliant?

## Offer New Financial Services

### 1. Strategic Benefits 

The usage of digital assets for activities such as saving, lending, and borrowing has surged in recent years. 2 Expanding your wallet's services to include these capabilities can unlock several potential business benefits:


- **Market Differentiation**: Introducing new financial services can help your wallet or application stand out, attract new users, and create monetization opportunities – especially in regions where access to traditional financial services is limited.

- **Improved Engagement**: Broadening your offerings may encourage users to interact more frequently with your product, which could contribute to improved retention and stronger user loyalty over time.


### 2. Options on Stellar

- Earning Yield From Real-World Assets   
- Lending and Borrowing  
- Earning Liquidity Provider Rewards  


### 3. Key Considerations  

When evaluating new financial services for your wallet, consider factors like:

- **Liquidity**: Is there sufficient market depth and liquidity to ensure smooth transactions and minimize slippage?  


- **Market Demand**: What are your users' needs and risk preferences? Are they seeking passive earning opportunities or higher-risk investments? 


- **Source of Yield**: How is yield generated? Does it rely on returns from real-world assets (RWAs) like treasury bills, or more variable sources like DeFi protocols?


- **Regulatory Compliance**: Is the service or asset compliant with local, regional, or global regulations? 


## Support for Digital Assets  

### 1. Strategic Benefits 

Stablecoins reached $450B in monthly transactions in 2024 – about half of Visa's volume.3  Expanding your wallet or application's support for digital assets can help you tap into the growing demand for digital payments and remittance solutions, potentially leading to: 


- **Increased Revenue**: Supporting a broader range of digital assets could drive higher transaction volumes, opening the door to new revenue streams through transaction fees, exchange spreads, and premium features like instant conversions.


- **Enhanced Trust**: Offering fiat-backed digital assets, particularly those that comply with regulatory frameworks such as MiCA, could help build your product's credibility with traditional markets that prioritize stability and regulatory compliance.


### 2. Options available on Stellar

You can expand asset support in your wallet in two ways: by directly listing new assets or by integrating with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) to enable access to a broader range of assets.


### 3. Key Considerations 

When evaluating new assets or trading capabilities for your wallet, consider factors like:

- **Transaction fees**: What are the associated transaction fees, and how do they compare to other options? Are the fees manageable for your userbase?

- **Asset backing**: What assets back the stablecoin or liquidity pools on the DEX/AMM? How transparent is the issuer or protocol regarding these assets?  

- **Usability and interoperability**: How easily does the stablecoin or DEX/AMM integrate with dApps, and are on/off-ramp options available? 

- **Liquidity and transaction volume**: Does the stablecoin or DEX/AMM have sufficient liquidity to ensure smooth transactions?
