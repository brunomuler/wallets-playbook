# RWA Use Cases 

Tokenized RWAs — such as fiat currencies, government bonds, and commodities — are one of the fastest-growing segments in crypto. On Stellar, many of them are already live and integrated into wallets around the world. RWAs can help your wallet serve a broader range of markets and use cases, unlock new monetization opportunities, and drive engagement. 

**Here are a few key use cases for wallet developers:**   

### 1. Onchain Savings & Yield 

By supporting access to yield-bearing RWAs like Etherfuse's Stablebonds, wallets can offer savings opportunities backed by real financial instruments. Many of these are permissionless and compatible with DeFi protocols on Stellar. 

### 2. Consumer Cross-Border Payments 

RWAs like stablecoins can serve as fast, low-cost mediums of exchange for cross-border remittances and payments. Combined with Stellar's global on- and off-ramp network, wallets can enable seamless conversion between cash and crypto. 

### 3. Hedges Against Inflation 

Wallets can help users preserve purchasing power by giving them access to RWAs denominated in historically strong currencies, like USD- or EURC-backed stablecoins. These assets are commonly used as safeguards in countries with high inflation or local currency volatility.  

### 4. B2B Payments 

Tokenized RWAs can also enable fast, transparent, and cost-effective settlement for cross-border business payments. Wallets can support invoicing and supplier payouts, helping to streamline operations for businesses operating across multiple currencies. 

### 5. Treasury Diversification 

Wallets can enable businesses or individuals to hold diversified portfolios using tokenized RWAs like government bonds, money market funds, and stablecoins – providing access to traditionally inaccessible financial products.
