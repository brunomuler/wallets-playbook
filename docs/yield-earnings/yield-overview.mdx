# Yield Overview

Wallets on Stellar can offer users access to yield-earning opportunities by integrating with protocols and assets that generate onchain returns. These can be valuable tools for increasing user acquisition, engagement, and retention  — especially in regions where traditional financial services are inaccessible or underperforming. 

**There are several ways you can expose your users to yield opportunities:**

### 1. Yield-bearing assets
 Assets like Etherfuse’s Stablebonds or tokenized treasury bills offer returns backed by real-world financial instruments. Different assets use different mechanisms to generate and distribute returns – from fixed rates to variable yields. 


### 2. DeFi lending and liquidity protocols
 Protocols like Blend let users lend assets or provide liquidity in exchange for yield. Stellar wallets are increasingly integrating with Blend to offer borrowing, lending, and yield-generation features natively, helping users put idle capital to work without leaving the app. 


### 3. AMM liquidity provision
 Stellar’s native AMM – accessible through interfaces like Aquarius, StellarX, and Phoenix – enable users to earn a share of trading fees by contributing to liquidity pools. Each application provides different user experiences such as token incentives and governance, but they all leverage the same underlying AMM built directly into the Stellar protocol.
