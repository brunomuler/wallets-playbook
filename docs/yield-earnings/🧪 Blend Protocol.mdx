# Blend Protocol

## Introduction

Blend helps users, DAOs, and institutions deploy multi-asset lending and borrowing pools on the Stellar smart contract platform. The protocol enables users to supply assets as collateral, borrow against that collateral, and earn rewards through the emissions system.

As wallets look to expand their functionality and attract users seeking DeFi features, integrating Blend presents a compelling opportunity. With Blend, wallets can offer their users effortless access to yield-generating opportunities without ever leaving their familiar wallet environment.

## Why Integrate with Blend

Integrating Blend brings several strategic benefits to wallet providers:

- **Yield Opportunities:** Allowing users to lend tokens into Blend pools can generate yields and rewards.
- **Increased User Engagement:** Users using Blend pools as yield-generating accounts showed higher retention rates, with an increase of 60% in some cohorts.
- **Transparency:** Built on Stellar, Blend transactions settle quickly and transparently with minimal fees, reinforcing trust among your users.

## How to Integrate Blend into Your Wallet for Yield Generation

1. **Choose Your Integration Framework:**  
   Decide how you want to integrate Blend. You can interact directly with Blend for maximum control, leverage the [Blend Fee Vault](https://docs.blend.capital/tech-docs/integrations/fee-vault) for flexible revenue sharing with a single pool, or use [DeFindex](https://docs.defindex.io/wallet-developer/introduction) to access multiple pools at the same time and enable revenue sharing.

2. **Select Pools for Your Users:**  
   There are various Blend pools for lending and borrowing different assets, each with unique APY and reward rates. Review the available options and choose pools that align with your usersâ€™ needs.  
   - Explore pools: [Blend Pools Dashboard](https://mainnet.blend.capital/)
   - With DeFindex, you can integrate multiple pools and dynamically switch to the best-performing ones without additional user signatures. See available strategies in the [Deploy Vault App](https://app.defindex.io).

3. **Define Your Revenue Model:**  
   Decide whether to pass 100% of the yield to users or use intermediary contracts to manage and monetize yield distribution. Both the [Blend Fee Vault](https://docs.blend.capital/tech-docs/integrations/fee-vault) and [DeFindex](https://docs.defindex.io/wallet-developer/introduction) support flexible monetization models.

4. **Design the User Experience:**  
   Lending protocols can be complex. Consider simplifying the interface by showing only relevant information, such as a separate lending balance for each asset (e.g., USDC) and the current yield rate. Both Blend and DeFindex provide tools to display up-to-date yield information.

5. **Review Technical Requirements:**  
   - Classic Stellar wallets (starting with G) can interact with Blend, even though itâ€™s a smart contract protocol.
   - If your app uses Horizon, youâ€™ll need to use an [RPC](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/rpc) to submit Soroban transactions.
   - For detailed technical steps, see the [Blend Integration Guide](https://docs.blend.capital/tech-docs/integrations/integrate-pool) or the [DeFindex Wallet Developer Section](https://docs.defindex.io/wallet-developer/introduction).
