# AMMs and Pool Protocols

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and pool protocols are essential DeFi infrastructure that enable decentralized trading, lending, and yield generation. These protocols allow users to provide liquidity to pools and earn rewards, while also facilitating seamless asset swaps and lending/borrowing operations.

## Lending & Borrowing Protocols

Lending and borrowing protocols allow users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. These protocols are fundamental to DeFi as they enable capital efficiency and provide yield opportunities for asset holders.

## Yield Aggregators & Managed Pools

Yield aggregators and managed pool protocols help users optimize their returns by automatically managing and rebalancing their investments across multiple DeFi strategies. These protocols abstract the complexity of yield farming and provide simplified access to diversified DeFi opportunities.

## CDP & Basis Trading

Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) and basis trading protocols allow users to mint stablecoins or other synthetic assets by locking up collateral. These protocols enable users to access liquidity without selling their underlying assets, and often provide opportunities for basis trading and arbitrage strategies.
