# Stellar Ramps

Stellar Ramps is a suite of open standards that makes it easy for wallets and applications to connect with a global network of on- and off-ramps offered by Stellar Anchors – institutions and fintechs that bridge Stellar to traditional payment rails. This infrastructure allows end users to seamlessly exchange local fiat for digital assets onto the Stellar network (and vice versa) directly within a wallet, which they can then store, send, or use onchain. 

By implementing a single set of standards, wallets like yours can quickly integrate with individual anchors that use those standards and offer their users access to a growing set of on- and off-ramps. But supporting Stellar Ramps doesn’t just improve usability – it can also increase engagement.

Keep reading to learn about the two main integration models supported by Stellar Ramps and how to choose the one that best fits your product.
