# Integration Models



There are two main integration models for Stellar Ramps, defined by the SEP-24 and SEP-6 standards:
- **[SEP-24](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/sep-24) – Interactive Web App Flow**
- **[SEP-6](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/sep-6) – Programmatic API Flow**


Stellar also supports ramps using their own models not covered by Stellar SEPs, like Coinbase and MoonPay, these are not covered in this document.


## Overview

Stellar Ramps enable users to:
- Deposit funds from fiat into crypto wallets.
- Withdraw crypto into fiat.

Two standards exist for wallet and ramp integrations:



## SEP-24: Interactive Ramps

### Key Characteristics
- **Interactive UI:** User is redirected (or embedded via iframe/webview) to a ramp-hosted web app for deposit or withdrawal.
- **Ramp Responsibilities:**  
  - User experience (forms, KYC, instructions).  
  - Regulatory compliance.  
  - Fiat settlement.
- **Wallet Responsibilities:**  
  - Initiate the flow using `/transactions/interactive`.
  - Handle callback and transaction status updates.

### Integration Steps
1. [Discover ramp endpoints via SEP-1](https://developers.stellar.org/platforms/anchor-platform/next/admin-guide/sep1).
2. Initiate an interactive deposit or withdrawal request
3. Display the returned URL in a browser or iframe.
4. Poll the `/transactions` endpoint to track status.



## SEP-6: Programmatic Ramps

### Key Characteristics
- **API-Driven:** Fully programmatic deposit and withdrawal instructions (no ramp-hosted UI).
- **Client Responsibilities:**  
  - Build all KYC flows 
  - Collect and securely transmit user data to ramp.  [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md)  
- **Ramp Responsibilities:**  
  - Provide instructions and status of KYC and transactions through API.
- **Best For:**  
  - Platforms needing full UX control

### Integration Steps
1. [Discover ramp endpoints via SEP-1](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/sep-1).
2. Call `/deposit` or `/withdraw` endpoints.
3. Present returned instructions directly in your UI.
4. Track status with [`/transactions`](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/sep-6#response-2).

## Summary


| Feature           | SEP-24                                         | SEP-6                                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Flow Type         | Interactive (web-based)                      | Programmatic (API-based)                      |
| UX Control        | Hosted by the ramp (iframe or redirect)         | UI controlled by the wallet/app                  |
| Use Cases         | Wallets needing simple, user-friendly flow    | Wallets looking for a more custom, native experience |
| Compliance (KYC)  | Ramp-hosted UI handles KYC & identity checks | Client collects and sends user data to ramp.  [SEP-12](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0012.md)     |
| **Pros**          | ✅ Easier to integrate<br/> | ✅ Highly customizable UX<br/>✅ Better user experience potential |
| **Cons**          | ❌ Less customizable<br/>❌ Embedded UI may hurt UX | ❌ More complex integration<br/> |



## Choosing Between SEP-24 and SEP-6

- **Use SEP-24 if:**
  - You want an easy integration with minimal UI and UX overhead.
  - Providing a custom interface is not a priority.

- **Use SEP-6 if:**
  - You want full control over UX.
  - You want to provide a custom interface.
