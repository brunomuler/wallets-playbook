# Sponsor Smart Wallets

Smart Wallets use a different structure from Classic Wallets, which also makes the sponsorship process different.

- **Classic Wallets** must hold a reserve of XLM based on account usage (e.g. account creation, adding trustlines). They also pay a small **Inclusion Fee** per transaction.  
- **Smart Wallets** are contracts. They do not require reserves, but they pay both an [Inclusion Fee](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering#inclusion-fee) and a [Resource Fee](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering#resource-fee). The Resource Fee is proportional to how much storage, computation, and bandwidth the contract consumes, effectively ‚Äúrent‚Äù for running on the network.

## Sponsor a Smart Wallet

To improve UX, these fees can be covered by a sponsoring account, so users don't need to hold XLM. This makes onboarding into smart wallets seamless.

### Sponsoring With the Wallet Backend


The [stellar/wallet-backend](https://github.com/stellar/wallet-backend) project provides server-side tooling to make user onboarding with smart wallets seamless.

### Key Features
- **Fee Sponsorship ("Gasless" UX)**  
  Uses **fee-bump transactions** so a distribution account pays transaction fees.
- **Channel Accounts**  
  Manages sequence numbers and scales throughput by using pre-funded channel accounts.
- **API Access**  
  Exposes endpoints for building, signing, and submitting transactions, secured by JWT-based authentication.

### Sponsorship Flow
1. **Frontend (Smart Wallet App)**  
   - User signs an operation according to their wallet‚Äôs contract logic (e.g., passkey, policy signer).
   - App sends the signed payload to the backend.

2. **Backend (wallet-backend)**  
   - Builds the transaction using a **channel account** for sequence numbers.  
   - Wraps it in a **fee-bump transaction** so the **distribution account** pays the fee (and any reserve if needed).  
   - Submits the transaction to Stellar RPC.  
   - Polls for confirmation and returns the result.

3. **Result**  
   - User‚Äôs wallet action succeeds.  
   - User never needed to hold XLM for fees or reserves.  
   - Sponsor absorbs costs and can manage them.
