description: Learn about the two main types of wallets on Stellar—Classic Wallets and Smart Wallets—and how they differ in structure, capabilities, and implementation.

# Stellar Wallet Types

Stellar supports two primary types of wallets: **Classic Wallets** and **Smart Wallets**. Both are compatible with the Stellar network but differ in how they store state, authorize transactions, and interact with smart contracts.

Choosing between them depends on your wallet’s intended use case, UX goals, and the level of programmability required.

---

## Classic Wallets

A **Classic Wallet** is built using Stellar's original account model. It relies entirely on features built into the core Stellar protocol and does not use Soroban smart contracts.

### Structure
- Backed by a **Classic Stellar Account** (G... address)
- Uses **Ed25519** public/private keypairs for signing
- Account data (balances, thresholds, signers) is stored in **Stellar Core**

### Features
- Send/receive XLM or issued assets
- Manage trustlines
- Add/remove signers
- Participate in the Stellar DEX
- Sponsor other accounts or trustlines
- Store key-value data with `ManageData`

### Use Cases
- Lightweight mobile wallets
- Custodial wallets with backend key management
- Low-fee, high-throughput applications
- Wallets that don’t need smart contract logic

### Technical Considerations
- All transactions must be signed directly or via multi-signature rules
- Application logic must be enforced off-chain or via signer setup
- No on-chain logic beyond what is built into the protocol

## Smart Wallets

A **Smart Wallet** is powered by a **Soroban smart contract account**. These wallets use a contract as their controlling entity and enable fully programmable authorization and storage logic on-chain.

### Structure
- Backed by a **Soroban Contract** account
- Controlled by contract logic, not by a single public key
- May be created and initialized by an external app or user

### Features
- Custom account behavior (e.g., social recovery, fee splitting, delegation)
- Programmable authorization using Soroban's `require_auth` and address types
- Can interact with other contracts (e.g., AMMs, bridges, disbursement contracts)
- May use custom key schemes (e.g., secp256r1, passkeys)

### Use Cases
- Smart contract wallets with fine-grained permissions
- Wallets integrated into on-chain DeFi protocols
- Delegated signing with external identity systems
- Complex business logic on-chain

### Technical Considerations
- Requires contract deployment and initialization (typically via your app)
- Fees must be covered by the wallet or a sponsor
- Must use the Soroban SDK to invoke contracts and submit transactions
- Cannot be interacted with via Classic-only APIs

## Classic vs Smart Wallet Comparison

| Feature                        | Classic Wallet       | Smart Wallet                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Backed By                     | Stellar Core Account | Soroban Contract Account       |
| Authorization                 | Keypair / Signers    | `require_auth` contract logic |
| On-Chain Logic                | No                   | Yes                            |
| Custom Recovery Mechanisms    | Off-chain only       | Fully programmable             |
| Compatibility                 | Fully supported      | Soroban-only features required |
| Use in DeFi                   | Limited (via DEX)    | Full on-chain DeFi support     |
| Fee Management                | Native               | Requires sponsor or logic      |

## Choosing the Right Wallet Type

| Use Case                                      | Recommended Wallet Type |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Simple wallet for sending/receiving XLM       | Classic Wallet           |
| Wallet with social recovery and smart auth    | Smart Wallet             |
| DEX trading and token swaps                   | Classic Wallet (via DEX) |
| Interacting with Soroban smart contracts      | Smart Wallet             |
| Low-cost onboarding with sponsorship          | Both supported           |

## Developer Notes

You can support **both wallet types** in the same application if you abstract transaction signing and account handling appropriately. Many builders start with Classic Wallets and progressively add Smart Wallet functionality as their needs evolve.
