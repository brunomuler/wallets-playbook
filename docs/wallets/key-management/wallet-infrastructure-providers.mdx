# Wallet Infrastructure Providers

Wallet infrastructure solutions provide enhanced security and user experience by leveraging external key managers, hardware security modules, and authentication methods like social authentication methods and passkeys.

These solutions help wallet developers implement secure key storage and management without requiring users to directly handle private keys, while maintaining the security benefits of non-custodial wallets.
