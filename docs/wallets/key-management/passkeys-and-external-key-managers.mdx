# Passkeys and External Key Managers

Modern key management solutions provide enhanced security and user experience by leveraging external key managers, hardware security modules, and advanced authentication methods like passkeys.

These solutions help wallet developers implement secure key storage and management without requiring users to directly handle private keys, while maintaining the security benefits of non-custodial wallets.
