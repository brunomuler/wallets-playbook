# Centralized Exchanges

In addition to on- and off-ramps, wallets can also integrate with centralized exchanges (CEXs) that support Stellar assets. CEXs are typically custodial and are often regulated. These exchanges can provide access to deep liquidity, broad asset coverage, and advanced trading features – making them a valuable tool in your wallet’s toolkit.
